
JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:

Dictionaries in Python.
Hashes in Perl and Ruby.
Hash tables in C and C++.
HashMaps in Java.
Associative arrays in PHP.
The fact that this data structure is so widely used is a testament to its versatility. Since everything (bar core types) in JavaScript is an object, any JavaScript program naturally involves a great deal of hash table lookups. It's a good thing they're so fast!

The "name" part is a JavaScript string, while the value can be any JavaScript value — including more objects. This allows you to build data structures of arbitrary complexity.

===================


There are two basic ways to create an empty object:

var obj = new Object();

And:

var obj = {};

These are semantically equivalent; the second is called object literal syntax, and is more convenient. This syntax is also the core of JSON format and should be preferred at all times.

======================

Object literal syntax can be used to initialize an object in its entirety:

var obj = {
  name: 'Carrot',
  for: 'Max', // 'for' is a reserved word, use '_for' instead.
  details: {
    color: 'orange',
    size: 12
  }
};

Attribute access can be chained together:

obj.details.color; // orange
obj['details']['size']; // 12

=======================

The following example creates an object prototype, Person and an instance of that prototype, You.

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Define an object
var you = new Person('You', 24); 
// We are creating a new person named "You" aged 24.

====================

Once created, an object's properties can again be accessed in one of two ways:

//dot notation
obj.name = 'Simon';
var name = obj.name;

And...

// bracket notation
obj['name'] = 'Simon';
var name = obj['name'];
// can use a variable to define a key
var user = prompt('what is your key?')
obj[user] = prompt('what is its value?')

These are also semantically equivalent. The second method has the advantage that the name of the property is provided as a string, which means it can be calculated at run-time. However, using this method prevents some JavaScript engine and minifier optimizations being applied. It can also be used to set and get properties with names that are reserved words:

obj.for = 'Simon'; // Syntax error, because 'for' is a reserved word
obj['for'] = 'Simon'; // works fine
