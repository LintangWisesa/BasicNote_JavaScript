
JavaScript Methods

JavaScript methods are the actions that can be performed on objects.
A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.
Methods are functions stored as object properties.

============

Accessing Object Methods

var person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    fullName : function() {
       return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
};

console.log(person.fullName())

If you access the fullName property, without (), it will return the function definition:

console.log(person.fullName)

====================

Adding New Methods
Adding methods to an object is done inside the constructor function:

function person(firstName, lastName, age, eyeColor) {
    this.firstName = firstName;  
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyeColor;
    this.changeName = function (name) {
        this.lastName = name;
    };
}

myMother.changeName("Andi");
